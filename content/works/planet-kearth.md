**KEARTH** is a fictional planet created by Turito Yuenan (me), originally for an Undertale AU called KEARTHTale which is basically "*what if Undertale had more worldbuilding and also happened on this planet I just made up?*".

Those days are gone, and now with little motivation left to make that AU, Planet KEARTH remains as a little worldbuilding project.
