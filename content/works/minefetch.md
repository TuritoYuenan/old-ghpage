Minefetch is a project to make a mod for Minecraft and Minetest that replicates the popular Unix/Window tool "[Neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch)". Similar to how Neofetch is a command line tool that lists out system information of your computer, Minefetch lists out info about the game, world and the player.
