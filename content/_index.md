## My personal website has migrated

turitoyuenan.github.io used to be my personal website built with Hugo. But in August 2023, I have switched to creating a dynamic website using SvelteKit and deployed using Cloudflare Pages

Meanwhile, I've decided to reuse this place as a Content Management System, since I didn't like the other approaches of integrating blogging into SvelteKit

- joshcollinsworth.com's method and fantinel.dev's method take use of mdsvex which allows writing markdown files with Svelte components for interactivity, but also means writing contents directly into the source code which I didn't like.
- Headless CMS programs and services let us write contents and transfer through APIs, but they were pretty hard to get my head around, and I also don't like setting up services
- I did have an idea to use Tumblr's API to fetch contents from my Tumblr blog but by then I should have used Wordpress or any aforementioned headless CMS anyways.
